#Services
Our services—research and evaluation, technology assistance and consulting, and training and coaching—are available separately or as an integrated package. You may need an external evaluator to design a plan that will help you understand whether your program is working as you anticipate. But sometimes an evaluation reveals that data systems need to be improved to get the information you need, or that annoying technical glitches interfere with complete and accurate data reporting. This might mean you need evaluation advice, along a few hardware or software updates and a bit of coaching so that you can be certain that new tools and practices will work well for your team.

We specialize in serving education, nonprofit and social programs, where knowledge grows and change happens. This means we understand your mission is our guide, your resources are delicately balanced, and accurate information can mean the difference between knowing whether to modify or grow a program. It also means we have an extra eye on security and confidentiality. We know you need to maintain participant trust and, for many programs, it's the law.
