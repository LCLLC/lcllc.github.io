#Mission:

Lund-Chaix Consulting was founded to assist organizations and individuals in utilizing research and technology to make decisions, solve problems, and advance social justice.

#Vision:

Knowledge is power: power to influence, power to change, power to make the right decisions. Everyone can have the knowledge they need to take control of their own future. This can mean discovering how to achieve your dreams and potential, or altering social power structures. At Lund-Chaix Consulting we envision a community where individuals have the information necessary to realize their goals and organizations have the tools and credibility to lead social change.

The need for evaluation research and technology improvements often go hand-in-hand. Problem solving through action research requires unbiased observations and careful reflection. Data systems must be user-friendly and functional to track accurately and make meaning of even the most easy-to-count data.
